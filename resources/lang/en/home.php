    'What_does_it_do_text' => 'RGeasy helps to select reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR in an easier way, since information such as Cq\'s values, usually required by other tools, is not necessary at the moment of the search, because information such as these are previously made available by the researchers developing the studies of reference gene validation, enabling the classification of reference genes for the combination of different conditions or treatments, which is not often addressed in most studies. RGeasy uses the RefFinder algorithm (XIE et al. 2012) for the classification of reference genes, resulting in a ranking of the most stable genes, and it still provides sets of primers for the selected genes.',
